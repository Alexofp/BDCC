You notice her pastel yellow fur, eyes the color of a green emerald and cat ears that show pink flesh on the inside. Normal reading glasses, a green top, long skirt, dark stockings, a belt with many pouches and a lab coat is what she is wearing. The lab coat is of a sterile white color with a bright green trim.")
