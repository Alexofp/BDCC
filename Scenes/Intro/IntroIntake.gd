Most of the corners are stuffed with metal crates or other types of cargo, all of it locked, behind you is a huge energy field that allows the spaceships to pass but keep the air in. The height of a hanger allows there to be many catwalks on the walls where all the guards stand, watching the fresh blood arrive. Your attention gets stolen by someone’s loud authoritative voice that gets echoed slightly.")

He has blue eyes and a short fancy haircut, slowly swishing behind him is a black canine tail. He spots bulky shoes, tight black pants, leather belt with some pouches and a dark blue military jacket with a bright glowing trim to it, everything just screams formal. The only armor he has are the carbon shoulder pads with the same bright trim.")
		
		saynn("Behind the officer is a very tall guard, more than 2 meters tall. You notice her face to be feminine but considering how much heavy armor she is carrying she must be quite strong. Her fur is of a strange dark-cyan color, the face features show that she is some kind of feline, ears have tassels on them and behind her is a very short tail. You notice that she holds a weapon, something that looks like a stun baton.")

That’s when you realize that the soft padding doesn’t really help much, the thing sits very uncomfortably on you, barely letting you breathe.

func getDevCommentary():
	return "So this is probably the earliest actual written scene if you don't count the fighting one ^^. If you ever been on RRDC, a place in second life, you will find all of this very familiar.. Because this is pretty much how intakes work in there x3. RRDC is basically a place for rp if you didn't know. I will be honest, I just wanted to turn that rp place into a game x3. Why? To tell my own stories I guess.. I only copied the prison idea itself, all the lore and characters and stories are fully written by me.\n\nBut yeah ^^. This scene introduces you to the captain, probably one of the most powerful people on the station. So of course he has to be kind ^^. But also strict and all that. He is balanced out by his bloodthirsty hornythirsty guard Risha. Risha is a bitch x3 she is clearly enjoying the power she has over inmates. Would be cool to maybe write some content for her where you somehow set her up, making it so she is caught and turned into an inmate herself. But that would require so much thinking.. I basically have to write 2 games then, where Risha is guard or inmate. And that sounds ehhhhhhh.. would be cool though"
