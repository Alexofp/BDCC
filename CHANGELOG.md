# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
## [0.1.5] - 2024-08-02
### Added
- Added ability to create scenes and quests with datapacks! Give your characters whole storylines or just a unique encounter or two, the new system is very flexible. No need to pull your hair out with the godot editor, new scenes/quests could be created entirely from inside the game. No need to learn complicated scripting languages, I coded a simple (but powerful) visual system where you create scenes by assembling them out of blocks (Scratch-like system).
- [Scene/quest editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d08c8fc-e7b6-4357-97d5-09a1678673f4). Packed full of little features that should save you, the creators, your time and nerves. See your scene running in-game with just one button press. Built-in spell checker. Ability to save and reuse whole blocks of.. blocks. Simple undo-redo system. Lots of little sub-windows that will help you add bbcodes into your text, choose animations and locations. If you want to learn how to use this editor to create scenes, I wrote a [tutorial](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki/Datapack-scene-creator-tutorial) that will hopefully help you get started. There is also a page that contains some [advanced topics](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki/Datapack-scene-creator.-Advanced-stuff) like how to start fights or do hand-written sex scenes.
- Ability to reload datapacks. This will reset the characters to their initial datapack state while keeping some stuff like their slavery status. Useful if datapack got updated.
- You can now choose which mods and datapacks your datapack depends on. Missing dependencies will be seen as red for the users. (If you have submitted any datapacks that use mods, it would be great if you'd re-submit them with the required mods specified)
- Skins added by the datapacks now display their author and datapack id.
- Datapack characters got more settings. Can make them feel more scripted by excluding them from encounters. Can make them struggle out of restraints better or worse.
- (All contributed by AverageAce) Better room descriptions, Announcer sells more bdsm restraints, Alex/Risha/Eliza got unique features shown on their dolls (Alex's spine, Risha's piercings, Eliza's necklace), better sheath sprite.
- (Sprites by MaxMaxouCat) Alternative nurse uniform with crocs. Nurses will spawn with one or the other.
- Added critical failures to the struggling minigame that make the gear sit more tightly on you.
- [Smart locks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fdbe411-fb85-4b46-b766-7afbb7c28570)! When tying you up, NPC's now might add one of 3 possible smart locks onto the locked gear, making struggling out of them impossible. The frequency of this can be changed in the settings. The 3 types of smart locks are:
- Tight lock. Can only be unlocked by using multiple restraint keys.
- SlutLock (tm). The most frequent smart-lock. Can only be unlocked by completing a task (or tasks) that the lock gave you. As you can guess, it gives you some very slutty tasks..
- Keyholder lock. You must beat-up the person who locked you to get the unique key required to open the smart-lock.
- Restraint keys are now illegal and are only sold by Announcer at a 3x price. But you will also loot more restraint keys if you have any smart locks on you.

### Changed
- Images (skins/portraits) stored inside datapacks will be loaded only when needed, hopefully speeding up datapack loading.
- Code for the struggling minigame/system got refactored and cleaned up.
- Can now export datapacks from the web version.

### Fixed
- Datapack characters should now spawn with full balls.
- Datapacks that have ID that's different from the filename should now work better and be delete-able.
- Taypo down. 69+ more to go.

## [0.1.4] - 2024-07-01
### Added
- [Artica Sparkle](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/0e38161d-02a3-4e77-b82a-8be539b56149) arrives to BDCC! She is the star of this update, an extremely shy fluff.. but you know what they say about the shy ones.. You can find Artica going through her intake process by hanging around near the checkpoint (player level required 10+). Help her adjust to her new prison life and find out about how such a shy girl managed to ended up in such a dark place.
- Artica's content is focussed on these kinks: Corruption, breeding, pawplay (a lot of pawplay). But there are also scenes that include: forced nudity, chastity, tentacles, portals, hypnosis.. and much more that I won't spoil x3. Artica has so much written scenes that I had to split it into 3 google docs, it was just getting too laggy, hah. Total word count is 116k words/463 pages of text! It's not just lewd though, her content has so much more: casual stuff, wholesomeness, drama, roughness, everything! Her content has 2 endings too, a happy and.. a different one
- Artica's content has a loooot of new animations, make sure to check her scenes out.
- Datapacks! Datapacks allow you to easily create and share custom characters and also skins! Skins are loaded automatically but for the new characters to appear in your save you gotta 'load' the datapacks from inside the 'in-game menu -> Datapacks' menu.
- Datapacks editor. Fully built-in into the game, no coding knowledge or godot editor required. Create new characters and skins (and, maybe in the next updates, new scenes too)
- Datapack browser. Allows you to easily download other people's datapacks from inside the game (The list is handled by me, submit your datapacks in the #datapacks channel!)
- Options to adjust the size of pregnant bellies. Keep it realistic-ish or make it silly big! Also an option to scale the size depending on the litter size.
- Penises now have particles when cumming/cumming-inside! Don't expect fluid physics but it's better than nothing x3. Can disable them in the settings or increase the intensity and make them look silly!
- 3 new ear types for Canines. 1 new haircut. 1 new skin
- Lots of new alternative skins for existing hair by AverageAce

### Changed
- Slave haircut changing scene now supports changing the skin of the hair.

### Fixed
- Typpots (thanks to Rayfoward, Disillusioned-Gazer, Sayonix and Johnvic76)
- Some crashes (thanks to CanInBad)
- The debug command to duplicate npcs should work with the player now
- Crash that happens when you try to use a penis pump.. without a penis

## [0.1.3] - 2024-03-28
### Added
- Introducing [Socket](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/d78eaff7-f107-4512-89aa-87963cc775f5)! A new easy-going fennec enginner that needs help settling in. Help her do some little tasks around the station while getting into some lewd situations. Her content is focussed around casual sex and free use. To start her content visit the workshop after completing (or skipping) the portal panties quest. Socket's content comes with a lot of custom assets, animations, scene art, unique clothing. The production value for her content is very high ^^
- Ability to enslave dynamic NPCs! Break their spirit, kidnap them into your cell (Socket will help you prepare your cell for that), make them submit to you (like 4 ways to do it, be careful not to break their mind), train them! This is easily the feature that took the most time to complete. Still mostly a framework but there is already some fun to be had for sure. The framework is also highly expandable, including with mods ^^
- 3 specializations/skills for your slaves. Submissive, slut, pet. Focus on 1 or spend the time to train all 3 to a single slave, your choice. Submissive slaves can be trained to serve you, sluts can be trained to do prostitution, pets you can do walkies around the station with!
- Lots of basic actions to interact with your slave. Reward/punish your slave, talk with them, parade them around the station on a leash, force them into stocks, give them showers, manage their clothes, change their haircut.. Or just fuck them.
- Staff can also be enslaved but you will have to find a way to get your hands on some collars
- Inmate uniforms and underwear can now be [visibly damaged](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/f20408b0-f6d9-45af-aec6-816a1b2d363f) in procedural sex. Uniform has many damaged states, from just a few little holes to being mostly destroyed! Repair your clothing in the laundry (Damaged uniform sprites by MaxMaxouCat)
- Underwear, strapons and rope harness can now be dyed any color in the laundry!
- Fennec head, ears and tail. Also 1 new hair and skin
- Sybian can be installed in your cell by Socket. Ride it alone or with a slave
- Vents. Socket can now clear some vents for you, giving you one-way fast-travel to some locations around the station
- More dick skins by AverageAce!
- [Tail scale slider](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/f455fb16-17a1-4238-ba9b-90723e080ac5). Make your tail bigger or smaller in the character creator
- Ability to change the names of how npcs self-identify (herm, peachboy, etc) in the options
- Highly-experimental feature of turning any static npc into a dynamic one with the ability to enslave them. Accessable only through the debug menu

### Changed
- Restraints are grouped better in fights ([Pull request by Dalt](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/pull/56))
- Hypnovisor is more likely to be used by npcs with hypnosis fetish
- Computer hacking minigame for vion's cage should easier ([Pull request by PeteTimesSix](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/pull/55))

### Fixed

- Toggling the perk off now should truly toggle it off, removing any buffs

## [0.1.2] - 2024-01-23
### Added
- Alex Rynard content greatly expanded and is now finished. Help him figure out what the meaning of trust is. (70k new words/300+ pages of text, someone should stop me from doing such big projects)
- 4 'trust exercises' with Alex that are gradually unlocked over the course of his content. Lots of kinky stuff here like sex machines (includes new animation for sybian)
- Hypnokink mod by PeteTimesSix is integrated into the game. This is the first time I added content content that wasn't written by me ^^
- Portal panties rewamp! [Portal sex animations added](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/d6a54186-9ef1-46ec-9775-3cf19651850a). The random events now use the dynamic npcs. You can now buy portal panties and fleshlights from Alex after completing the portal panties quest. Can now force portal panties onto dynamic npcs (and have fun with them remotely). It's a big feature ^^
- [Penis pumps](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/17afd77c-f80e-4976-9ab6-07d1409cf86f). Can be bought from the medical. Can be used in procedural sex (and also used in a few new written scenes)

- Option to enable a harder struggling minigame (pull request by Dalt)
- 3 new skins by AverageAce + lots of new alternative dick skins from them
- Mod-makers can now define a function for their modded species that executes on each new generated dynamic npc of that species (useful for lots of things like changing bodyparts/skins)

### Changed
- Tooltip that shows someone's fetishes is now twice as wide and has 2 columns to fit more text (lots of fetishes these npcs have, huh)
- Android version should now be able to load saves from your documents/BDCCSaves folder without you having to go through the import process.
- Refactored how the (non-player) characters handle their equipped items. They now compare what they have to what they should have and fix that rather than resetting their entire inventory each time (with some help from Ranchar who added persistant items support)
- Pressing the 'forget' button in the encounters menu will ask for confirmation only once

### Fixed
- Inventory UI was making the rest of the ui go off-screen on small resolutions.
- Tyypos and some bugs
- Punctuation fixes by Rayforward

## [0.1.1] - 2023-11-22
### Added
- Jacki's content has been greatly expanded (173 pages/44k words). You can now find her in the gym after the stocks event. Fair warning, her content is based around some heavy kinks such as anal fisting, roughness, sounding, genital torture. Not much breeding there. But you can also corrupt the wolfie using kind methods.
- Some Alex Rynard content (45 pages/9.9k words). This is mostly an intro to his content, not much lewds there yet.
- Hypnovisor mk1 item. Can be bought from Alex if you complete his current content. Can be used in procedural sex
- [New inventory UI](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/069fc12b-41da-4765-bb72-9bcc249c5ada). Inventory and Looting/Vendomat/Stashing scenes now have a special new ui. It features icons for each item, a search bar and also item grouping to help against clutter.
- Breeder skill. Can be trained by orgasming inside others (filled strapons also counting) and getting people pregnant. Features 14 perks (2 perks were moved from the Cum Lover skill)
- Cum lover skill received 2 new replacement perks. Cum lover skill doesn't get trained from cumming inside others anymore.
- New 'from behind' pose for the vaginal/anal procedural sex.
- 4 new skins, one of them is for Jacki. [Preview](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/2336b53e-dc49-4d89-ab24-6b42cb9b3e3c)
- Impregnation chance modifier added to the game's options.
- Sex Event system that will power a lot of the future features (and is already used in the new perks)

- Typpos

## [0.1.0] - 2023-10-06
### Added
- Tavi's route is finished! That makes the game completable from start to the end. Will you finally escape the prison? Who knows ^^. Complete her route and find out in one of the 3 endings that are all drastically different. At least 250+ pages/80k+ words of new content in this update
- [Visible chains!](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/assets/14040378/117c5fbb-bef3-434f-a9fa-ac08bc876271) Visible chains and leashes been added in most scenes that mention them ^^. (Original mod by PeteTimesSix)

- Ability to let Tavi sleep with you. Comes with 6 lewd scenes and ability to deny her in each

- Lots of new animations. Getting on all fours got better transitions. Better hug animation
- Choking added to procedural sex. With ability to turn it into choke-fuck (animated)
- Ability to put breast pumps on dynamic npcs during procedural sex. They can do it to you too if you're lactating ^^

### Fixed
- Can't keep the stocks anymore if you unlock them with a restraints key

## [0.0.24] - 2023-08-08
### Added
- [Skins!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007588662009155704/1121481683095527445/image.png) White paper dolls finally got their colors and they look fancy. Can be disabled in the settings if you prefer the old look.
- Tavi’s route is expanded! Tavi has a new foolproof plan of escape and she needs your help. 200+ pages/60k+ words of text, pretty much a novel. Next update will probably complete this route to the end, making the whole game completable! (But not done, 2 other routes planned)
- All static npcs have a skin defined for them. All dynamic npcs have a random skin and colors.
- [Support for custom skins! Click me to find out how to draw your own.](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki/Making-skins) Installing custom skins is as easy as putting them into the custom_skins folder.
- Change your skin and colors at any time using the Mirror in the bathrooms. Useful for old saves.
- Cum overlay. If a character is covered in any fluids, they will be visible on their doll. Changes depending on the amount of fluids.

- The scene of having your holes healed by Eliza got an animation.
- The scene where you encounter the latex alien during the mental ward content got an animation (A great one!)
- 3 new procedural sex activities added: Rimming sub, Getting rimmed by the sub, Feetplay.
- You can now choose the weight multipliers for each goal in the encounter settings. Rimming and feetplay have low weights by default, meaning NPCs will do them rarely to you.
- Sex activity editor. A very complicated tool but useful if you know GDScript. Some examples in the AssetsSource folder

### Changed
- Gender distribution of player character’s kids now follows the distribution in the encounter settings
- Pose doesn’t change randomly if you select the ‘continue fucking’ option during procedural sex.

### Fixed
- If you skip the journey when you are leashed, you will be teleported to your destination now. ([Fix by Niel](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/pull/17))

- Second accepted code contribution! Fertility skill with 10 new perks designed for mothers ^^. ([Pull request by Firi](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/pull/14))
- The final Arena battle against Avy is finished! It won't be that simple.. Because it's an entire quest! Will you become the new Grand Champion or will Avy The Unbeatable keep the throne to herself forever?
- Lots of new Rahi scenes that train her skills. Below are all the new stuff, pages upon pages of it (This is probably the last time I focus on Rahi for an update x3)
- Rahi's petplay is expanded with puppy training. Can take Rahi on walkies around the prison now
- Choking punishment for Rahi. If you go too far - you might make Rahi forget one of her skills entirely.. allowing you to experience the content of that skill again
- Rahi can join you in your bed when you go to sleep.
- 8 morning scenes where Rahi wakes you up with sex. Can be toggled on or off

- New perk for the BDSM skill that really rewards perfect hits during the struggling minigame

- Imagepacks now support layered images, ability to define art for procedural npcs and also ability to attach art to any scene

### Changed
- If you manage to resist Npc's attempts of putting bdsm gear on you during sex, they will eventually give up
- Names for breast sizes and also milk amount got adjusted to be slightly more realistic. Slightly.
- New imagepacks are sorted to be first now

### Fixed

- More bugs that I don't remember..

## [0.0.22bugfix1] - 2023-04-19
### Added
- A few petplay scenes with Rahi
- Translator can now translate buttons and their descriptions

### Fixed
- The issue that made Tavi's main quest stuck after getting the drugs/door code
- Npc's status effects are now being processed too. Fixes Rahi's sore nipples not going away

## [0.0.22] - 2023-04-13
### Added
- Rahi's content got expanded into a full little story line. At least 200 pages/70k words of scenes (a novel worth of text) all about the brown kitty. It's fully completable from start to the end but the middle part is still missing some content. Since the part 1. This took all the time
- 4 'intro' story scenes and 8 main story scenes that will reveal why Rahi is the way she is. 2 endings
- Give Rahi tasks, reward or punish her, train Rahi's skills to make her better at various lewd activities. For now I consider the dominance and anal skills to be mostly complete but the others have some fun things to do too. This will be the focus of part 2
- Built-in auto translator. A very experimental feature. Don't expect to work well or work at all. Doesn't translate the buttons. Doesn't work in web builds
- Computer hacking minigame now has a built-in tutorial that explains you what to do. It will also spoil you the command if you're really stuck. Debug menu now has the option to skip this minigame
- You can now use strapons if you have a chastity cage. The cage will be hidden because of how the skeleton works.

### Fixed
- Crash when you pick the drink options during chastity content

## [0.0.21] - 2023-02-24
### Added
- Tavi's route is extended. ~100 pages of text. Help her try to contact the syndicate, find out more about her backstory. And more.
- A semi-realistic computer hacking minigame that can be encountered during Tavi's content.
- Get an ability to experience wooden horse torture during Tavi's content
- A little encounter with a nurse android named Nur-A
- Cum economy update! The way fluids are handled got heavily refactored. Collect fluids using a plastic bottle, a breast pump or by keeping used condoms. You can drink them or throw at your enemies using condoms. All of the interactions will have different effects depending on the fluids involved.
- The selling price of a plastic bottle depends on the fluids inside it.
- Breast pump. Allows you to milk your breasts. Breast pump mk2, the advanced version, milks you passively when worn.
- A perk that allows you to keep used condoms after procedural sex or written scenes if they were involved.
- All strapons now can be supplied with fluids. They will automatically 'cum' using these fluids when the sub cums.
- The strapons that npcs put on can have cum lube in it. Or real cum with a very small chance
- Horsecock dildo toy that can bought from The Announcer or by finding it during Tavi's content. Can be supplied with fluids that will be automatically 'injected' inside you when you ride it
- Procedural sex now supports stocks. Added a few encounters into the stocks punishment that triggers them.
- Npcs that like bodywritings might add a tallymark on you after each load. The lust damage from the perk got capped at 50%
- Built-in Mod manager. Can be enabled in the options. Allows you to manage your mods.
- Mod browser. Can be opened from the mod manager. Allows you to download mods straight from the game. I curate the mod list personally
- The BDCC.pck file now automatically gets generated and updated on Android when needed. First-time launch might be slower because of that
- A few new perks. Melee weapons damage, instant restraint escape, fluid experimenter
- The struggling minigame is different if you're blindfolded.

- Kait got her portrait
- Skills button only gets 'highlighted' with \[!\] if you can unlock new perks in that skill tree

## [0.0.20] - 2023-01-10
### Added
- Sex animations! Almost every lewd scene now includes an animation for the dolls. Procedural sex included
- Struggling out of restraints is now animated
- Forced male chastity content. Experience what it's like to wear permanent chastity cage over 7 lewd scenes (28k words/76 pages) with Eliza and optional cameos of 5 other characters. You will have a huge choice at the end of this little storyline. Scenes trigger every 5 days
- Strapons. Strapons can now be used inside the procedural sex by you or npcs. Strapons can be bought from The Announcer
- Procedural npcs now drop loot (oops, I forgot that when coding them)
- Encounter settings have been greately expanded. You can now choose the distribution of genders, species and restrict sertain activities from happening to you during procedural sex
- You can get wounded or have your holes painfull stretched during rough activities inside the procedural sex. These status effects won't go away until you get yourself healed by Eliza or by sleeping (sleeping won't help if you got wounded twice in a row)
- Can ask Eliza to heal you inside the cryopod
- Buffs tab inside the skills menu. Shows what buffs your character currently has and their source (equipped item, status effect or perk). Useful to see if the perks are actually working
- You can choose to keep the restraints on the procedural npc if you won the fight
- Mods can extend the game's core functions with GameExtenders. GameExtenders can subscribe to some events like player's updates and run code. Should lessen the need to override the core files of the game inside mods. Still an experimental feature

### Changed
- The function that updates player's status effects shouldn't run multiple times in a row anymore. General optimization

## [0.0.19] - 2022-12-05
### Added
- Random encounters overhaul! Old encounters with a few generic predefined npcs got replaced with new ones that use procedurally generated npcs. New encounters change depending on the npc's procedurally generated personality
- Sex engine! An initial implementation of it but already has too many features to list everything. All the important sex scenes will still be fully hand-written, only the random encounters with procedural npcs use the sex engine currently
- Sex engine supports vaginal/anal/oral sex, tribadism, drug use, condoms, bodywritings, bondage, violence. Player can be the dom that fully controls where the scene goes or a sub that is on a receiveing end and has to endure what the npc has in store for them or try to fight their decisions. Relatively easy to expand with more activities
- Procedural npcs. Guards, inmates, Nurses. Random name, gender, species, stats, attacks, equipment, personality, fetishes, likes/dislikes, etc. Should work with modded species out of the box
- Procedural npcs have a dynamic personality that will change after sex depending on many factors. An npc might become more subby or more mean for example
- New encounters menu where you can 'forget' procedural npcs and change some settings.
- 'Look for trouble' button in the 'Me' menu button. Forces an encounter if the current room has any that are possible
- Male chastity. Sometimes the guards will force a chastity cage on you. All the sex scenes got changed a bit to account for the chastity cage (Cage sprites by Max-Maxou)
- Forced permanent chastity cage. You choose this option during the character creator. Eliza will then force a chastity cage on you during the intro scene that you can never take off. Might be expanded in the future
- Captain, nurses and guards received their uniforms. Technically noone is nude anymore
- Mods can now specify a default portrait art for a modded character without creating an entire new imagepack

### Changed
- Penises look flacid when the characters have less than 50 lust. (Sprites by Max-Maxou)
- Skills are now grouped into a single 'Skills' tab instead of having one tab per skill, less clutter, easier to select on touch devices.
- Huge optimization of how npcs are processed. If the npc is not currently participating in any scene they are no longer being processed every tick. Unless they are pregnant. This should allow for pretty much unlimited amount of important/generated npcs without any lag
- Scrollbars are now more wide on android
- Cheat menu to spawn an item got changed to a better and easier to use one. Should be usable on android too

## [0.0.18] - 2022-10-26

### Added
- [Modding support!](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki) Mods can add pretty much anything, from a new item to a new quest. It's even possible to replace the game's files with modded ones, allowing for global modifications if someone dares to try that. Same mods should work both on desktop and android.
