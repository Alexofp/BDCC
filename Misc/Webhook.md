# Webhook
The webhook settings added in the Options can send the basic statistics to xtoys.app (or any other platform accepting JSON POST) for sex toy automation.

## Usage 

1. Open https://xtoys.app and connect to your toys.
2. Add the "BDCC Simple Webhook" script from Public Scripts (or import the Json in webhook_script.txt in the Misc folder)
3. Generate a random id by clicking the dice (might require an xtoys.app account), and copy the random value
4. Open BDCC, go to Options in the Webhook section set the URL to "https://webhook.xtoys.app/RANDOMVALUEHERE" remember to replace RANDOMVALUEHERE with the value from the previous step.
5. Tick the boxes to send either the stats (Pain, Lust, Stamina etc.) or the painful insertion triggers, or both.
6. Connect the script to devices in xtoys.app by clicking the D in the header.
7. Press play on the script in the xtoys.app dashboard.

Stat changes might have an update delay until the in-game scene progresses.
