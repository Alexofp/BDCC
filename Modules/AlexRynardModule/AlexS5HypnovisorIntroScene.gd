It seems that engineers can't stop thinking about work even during their break time because one of the corners has a long work table with a board above it that has a crazy amount of notes pinned to it.")

		saynn("[say=pc]Glasses?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]Yeah. I wired up a few highly-precise cameras to them that read your irises and there are also some LED strips that can send highly-concentrated light impulses.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=pc]Sounds.. dangerous.[/say]")

		saynn("Alex shrugs.")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]The obvious use case is in medicine. These LEDs are so strong, they are capable of performing laser eye surgery. The high-range high-density matrices of the cameras allows for the whole procedure to be completely automated. All the while being smaller than any auto-doc.[/say]")

		saynn("Really cool tech. But you don't really have any problems with your eyes..")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]But.. I decided to do something else with them. Do you know how your brain works? Any brain.[/say]")

		saynn("What a weird question.")

		saynn("[say=pc]Well, yeah, kinda. Lots of connected neurons..[/say]")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]Yeah, exactly. Your brain has inputs, like your eyes, internal layers that consist of neurons and some outputs, like your muscles.[/say]")

		saynn("You feel like you won't be able to follow him for long..")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]Basically, lights can trigger some of your neurons to fire. The cameras in these goggles can catch that through the microscopic twitches of your eye muscles and use that info to try to guess the internal logic of your brain. Obviously it takes a lot of time to gather enough entropy so this process is quite slow.[/say]")

		saynn("Wow..")

		saynn("[say=pc]You're saying that it can read minds?[/say]")

		saynn("So caring.")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]And if something goes really-really wrong and you will stop being able to talk, just close your eyes. Without access to your eyes, the LEDs shouldn't be able to affect you in any way.[/say]")
