		saynn("In the distance, Ricky's spaceship rumbles to life. You and the others watch in stunned horror as it lifts off, its engines churning dust into the air before rising into the dim, red sky. For a moment it hangs there, like a cruel joke of a promise.. before flying off, its silhouette gradually reducing down to a single dot.. before.. gone completely..")

		saynn("[say=intro_detective]Any of your claims will lack the most important part. Proof.[/say]")

		saynn("Nothing you say can change anything. So you just sigh.. and relax in bed. Feels so much better than that cage..")

		saynn("[say=intro_detective]I'm finishing the required paperwork.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=pc]How are you gonna make sure that this doesn't happen?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=intro_detective]Your sentence has been extended - an administrative penalty for the illegal actions.[/say]")
