She has side swept hair, length is medium, barely reaching her shoulder. The hair is purple as well with a few hair strands behind green. Her eyes are different in color, right one is red and left is green. You can see that the inside of her ears, mouth and tongue are all toxic-green, meaning that that’s the color of her flesh and blood.
