And, when the captain became the director of the whole AlphaCorp, some of her dreams actually became a reality.

Rather than trying to invent new materials or machine learning algorithms.. they looked back.. and saw huge untapped potential in what is already there. It took months of development.. but together they managed to develop a new prosthetic spine for Alex. One that wasn't bound by metal or wires.. but instead used artificial neurons and half-organic hard tissue. The era of surgical intervention was coming to its end, nanobots, tiny programmable robots made out of organic materials, were used to eat through the old prosthetic spine.. before constructing a new, much better one.")

Maybe, one day, the time will come when both of them will look into the future.. and realize that they've been staring at each other this whole time.")
