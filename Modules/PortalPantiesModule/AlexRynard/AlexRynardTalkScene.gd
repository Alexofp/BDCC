But otherwise, there is nothing special about him, medium height, strong build, emerald eyes, pointy and long canine muzzle with a black mark on it that all the foxes usually have. His fur is not very unique, white for the belly, cheeks, palms, digi feet and orange for the rest. Near his paws and toes the fur is visibly darker, pretty much losing all of its saturation. His long black hair is made into a careful ponytail.")

		saynn("Alex is wearing his engineer uniform, dark shirt and pants that are made out of some thick material and have a yellow trim to them. His only armor are the shoulder pads that give his outfit a slightly more assertive look. He is wearing a belt with many pouches but not a lot of tools.")

		saynn("Hard to tell but you do notice his pants bulging out slightly near the crotch, meaning there is probably a sheath with a canine cock hiding behind, all good on that front.")
