		saynn("Your palms brush over her round pregnant belly and reach her D-cup breasts. They look and feel big for such a small kitty. Your digits trace a few circles around the nipples, following the outline of the dark areolas. Kitty watches your hands doing things under the skirt and moans softly. She knows she can’t be too loud, you are still in a public area.")

		saynn("You continue, your digits begin rubbing the perky nips, little circular motions over the sensitive spots. Then you gently pinch them and the milk starts to flow again, coating your fingers. You wait until that calms down and switch to kneading her breasts, just like small kittens do with their moms. This kitten is blushing red, little moans keep escaping from her. As long as you’re milking her, her breasts keep lactating, producing a steady flow of her feline milk.")

		saynn("[say=rahi]T-this feels so good..[/say]")

		saynn("You kiss her cheek and keep kneading her breasts, sometimes pinching and tugging on her nipples. Kitty is being a good girl and taking it like a champ. Though it’s obvious how stimulating this is for her, after some more milking she arches her back again and starts squirming in your hands, she even covers her own maw, the amount of pleasure is just too much, kitty seemingly cums just from being milked. But you don’t stop, you keep groping and kneading her breasts until the milk stream starts to finally die down.")

		saynn("You pull your hands out and lick the fingers.. her milk tastes so great. Then you nibble on her ear again.")
